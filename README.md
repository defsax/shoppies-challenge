# OMDB Shoppies Challenge

## Description

This is Perry Defayette's submission for the Fall 2021 Shopify Front End Software Developer Internship. The app leverages the OMDB API to return a list of movies titles. The user can then select film titles to nominate and the app will save them to a list. After 5 films are selected, nominations are done!
